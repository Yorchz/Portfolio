## About me

I am a third-year student of the Engineering and Data Science degree that is taught at the ULPGC, University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.
In these three years at the university I have learned everything from marketing models to java programming. I have managed to develop a wide range of knowledge about what is big data and about the treatment of mass data to be able to make decisions from these. In addition, throughout my career I have learned about neural networks and about different database models for managing, consulting and maintaining them.

## Projects

We can differentiate into two types of projects those carried out by the university and those carried out for personal interest

Within the first group we can find the projects uploaded within the Github that range from the development of neural networks and classifiers of all kinds, to web development. Also within the academic field I have a group with a series of colleagues called the pentagon where this course we will be uploading different updates of one of the largest works in which I have participated to date.

In the second group we can see more interesting projects related to the subject of artificial intelligence, which is one of my favorite points within the race. Having not finished the two personal projects that I am developing, they are not visible yet, but I hope they will be soon.

## Strong points

Within the different possible specializations of my career, I am heading more towards specialization within the analysis and decision-making sector based on the study of data. This implies that my strengths are the following:

- Artificial intelligence
- Managing and working with databases
- Decision making techniques
- Marketing
